# üõí Dynamic Pricing Dashboard for Perishable Goods

A smart pricing engine for grocery retailers that dynamically adjusts prices of perishable items based on expiry, inventory, and demand. The goal is to **reduce food waste**, **boost sales**, and **optimize stock** using a rule-based discounting system with optional machine learning integration.

Inspired by modern solutions like **Wasteless**, this system is tailored for markets like **Walmart India** or local grocery chains with POS systems.

## üìå Project Objective

Traditional grocery stores lose profits due to rigid static pricing for items that are close to expiry or overstocked. This project builds a **real-time pricing dashboard** to:

- Monitor inventory and expiry in real-time
- Apply **dynamic discounts** using priority rules
- Improve turnover of near-expiry items
- Reduce food waste and markdown loss
- Increase profit per square foot

## ‚öôÔ∏è Dynamic Pricing Rules Engine

This rule engine determines the final price of each item based on the first matched condition, **in order of priority**.

| Priority | Rule Name        | Condition                | Factor             | Discount |
|----------|------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|----------|
| 1        | Critical Expiry   | `daysToExpiry <= 1`      | Expiry Date         | 50%      |
| 2        | Near Expiry       | `daysToExpiry <= 3`      | Expiry Date         | 25%      |
| 3        | High Stock        | `stock > 150`            | Inventory Level     | 15%      |
| 4        | Low Demand        | `salesVelocity < 5`      | Sales Rate          | 10%      |

üìå **Rule Application Logic**:

- Rules are applied in **priority order**
- **Only one discount** is applied per product (no stacking)
- If no rule matches, the price remains unchanged

## üßÆ Dataset Structure (CSV)

The system reads a CSV with the following columns:

| Column Name      | Description                          |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Product          | Name of the item                     |
| Category         | Department or item category          |
| Stock            | Current inventory count              |
| Expiry           | Days left until expiry               |
| Original Price   | Base price of the product            |
| Current Price    | Discounted price (after rule)        |
| Discount         | Percentage discount applied          |
| Sales Velocity   | Units sold per day                   |

## ü§ñ Machine Learning (Optional XGBoost Model)

- Uses XGBoost Regressor to predict ideal discount percentage based on:
  - Stock
  - Expiry days
  - Sales velocity
  - Category encoding

This adds an **AI-driven layer** that can complement rule-based discounts or override them based on accuracy.
